  A CLI tool for generating modular structures for Flutter projects.
  - Automatically generates modular and test-ready folder structures.
  - Ensures adherence to SOLID Principles for maintainable code.
  - Integrates Test-Driven Development (TDD) with optional testing templates.
  - Supports popular packages like GetX and Dio.

- **[Get Translations Generator](https://github.com/genss333/flutter-modules-generator):**
  A Dart CLI tool designed to streamline the process of generating translation files for Flutter applications. This tool automates the conversion of a CSV file containing translations into a Dart file compatible with the GetX package, making multi-language support   
  faster and more efficient.
    - **Key Features**
      - Automated Translation File Generation:
      - Converts translations from a CSV file into a structured Dart file for GetX.
      - Supports multiple languages with key-value pairs.
    - **Code Organization**
      - Generates a Translations class for managing translation keys and their corresponding values.
      - Includes a TranslateKeys class for type-safe key usage.
    - **Easy Integration**
      - The output Dart file is ready to be integrated directly into a Flutter project using GetX.
 
- **[Generate Model](https://github.com/genss333/get_translations_generator.git):**
  A Bash script developed to streamline the process of generating Dart models from JSON files using quicktype. This tool is designed to save time and reduce manual work when handling API responses in Flutter projects by automating the conversion of JSON data to Dart       classes.
    - **Key Features**
      - Automated JSON to Dart Conversion:
      - Uses the quicktype tool to generate Dart models from JSON files automatically.
      - Ensures all properties are optional and final, improving null safety and immutability.
    - **Error Handling**
      - Validates inputs and provides clear error messages if commands fail or arguments are missing.
      - Simple Command-Line Interface:
    - **Accepts two arguments**
      - the path to the JSON file and the desired Dart file output location.

- **[Part-Time Finder ](https://github.com/genss333/partime_finder.git):**
  A capstone project built during university, designed to help users find part-time jobs. It integrates various modern tools and frameworks to deliver a seamless and efficient job-matching experience. The project connects job seekers with potential employers,       
  providing features to enhance collaboration and interaction.
  - **Key Features**
